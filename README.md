CI-CD with Azure DevOps

In this project I built a CI-CD pipeline for the weight tracker application and also a Terraform pipeline for the infrastructure, both in YAML format.
The pipline uses the weight tracker web application in this repository, an Ansible playbook for the deployment in the Ansible repository
and Terraform for the infrastrcture in it's own repository.

1. Ansible repo - hlink
2. Terraform repo - hlink

The main CI-CD pipeline assumes the infrastrcure is already deployed, for both the stage environment and the prod environment.
